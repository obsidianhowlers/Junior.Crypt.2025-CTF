You have found a bank server that stores customer balances encrypted (using the Paillier scheme). The server allows you to: view the encrypted customer balance and increase the balance. But there is a problem: the server does not check what number you "add" to the balance!
Can you increase the balance to $1,000,000 without knowing the bank's secret key?
