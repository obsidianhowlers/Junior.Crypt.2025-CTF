A friend from Grodno sent me this fragment of a map and wrote that it was somewhere here. Here is his letter. "Opposite is a cozy comfortable hotel in a historical building with an excellent location in the city center. Nearby is the Basilica, a pedestrian area with cafes, shops, you can walk around perfectly."
Name the place where my friend is staying. Flag in the format grodno{name}
