Sir Isaac Newton experimentally proved that white light consists of a mixture of seven colors, such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Newton also showed that you can collect these colors back into white light using a prism. We don't need a prism. And we have more colors. And we need to find a flag.
