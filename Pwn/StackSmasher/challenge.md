Our good old authentication server authd_v0.1 has served us faithfully for years. They say that it was written in pure C by our intern Uncle Matvey. He was always a bit generous with the length of received data. Maybe if you send it a very long username, it will get confused and return something more than just ‘Access Denied’?
